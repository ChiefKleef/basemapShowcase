**Executive Summary:**

_The Joint Center for Housing Studies_ requires a full web application built to visualize socioeconomic data across tracts of the Boston Metro Area. This application will allow users to interact with a complex dataset in an easy-to-use and performant user interface.

_Mimio LLC_ is uniquely qualified to build the desired application, due to our in-house web development experience, Geographic Information System expertise, and our past experience building web applications -- especially webmapping applications.

## General Project Structure

_Full Project Structure attached as Addendum A at end of document._

- **Development of web application visualizing socioeconomic data across tracts of the Boston Metro Area:**
  - Visualization of as many as 50 variables varying across 4 years
  - User-defined tract selections
  - Double stacking selections for a pass/fail data visualization
  - In general, an attractive and highly functional User Interface for interacting with data
  - Utilization of modern web frameworks and webmapping tools, including Mapbox Graphics Library 
- **Web Analytics:**
  - Instrumenting critical paths of the application with analytics code, allowing JCHS to gain key insights
  about who is using the map and how they interact with its features.
- **Optimization**
  - Ensure that the map functions well across all major browsers, devices.
  - Map will remain performant regardless of complexity

## Execution Timeline
- **Overview:**
  - _Start date:_ immediately
  - _Deliverable first major draft:_ mid-late February
  - _Review of first major draft:_ after delivery date mid-late February
  - _Site visit:_ late February
  - _Completion:_ late March
- **Additional Details**
  - We will be completing work in two-week sprints as defined by the Agile methodology of software development
  - Following each two-week sprint we will perform a demo, allowing us to review the work completed in the 
  previous sprint, as well as continuously integrate feedback. 

## Project Costs
- **$30,000 base cost split into the following payments:**
  - 25% paid up front ($7,500)
  - 25% paid upon delivery of first major draft by approximately mid-late February ($7,500)*
  - 50% paid upon completion of project in late March ($15,000)

- **Base cost stipulations:**
  - A first major draft shall be considered the first version of the application which meets all items defined by the Project Structure and also functions reasonably error free _[See: Addendum A]_
  - Minor additions to the project structure (defined as work taking less than 3 hours) negotiated prior to the final delivery will be delivered free of charge
  - Major additions to the project structure (defined as work taking more than 3 hours) negotiated prior to the final delivery will be handled hourly
  - After 600 hours of work completed by _Mimio LLC_, the project completion date may be renegotiated by both parties if determined necessary; all work logged after the 600-hour threshold will be handled separately from the base costs and paid hourly
  - Any additions to the project structure negotiated after the final delivery will be handled hourly
  - All hourly charges will be:
    - paid at $50/hour biweekly
    - tracked exactly by _Mimio LLC_ using an industry time tracking tool and reported back to the The Joint Center for Housing Studies in a formal document biweekly

- **$3480* estimated for site visit costs:**
  - Estimate is summarized in Addendum B
  - Paid as soon as site visit dates are finalized in order to minimize trip costs
  
- **Site visit cost stipulations:**
  - For all items delineated in the site visit costs, _The Joint Center for Housing Studies_ may substitute a working option of their own and deduct the relevant cost from the estimate _[See: Addendum B]_

## ADDENDUM A: Full Project Structure

### Requirements:
categorical map of data across tracts of the Boston Metro Area (BMA):
  - **As many as 50 variables varying across 4 years:** 
    - 4 years: 1990, 2000, 2010, 2014
    - 4 basic categories:
      - normal variable value (across all 4 years)
      - decile rank of tract for that variable (across all 4 years)
      - changes in values for certain time periods (ex: 2000 --> 2010, 1990 --> 2014)
      - decile rank of changes in values for certain time periods (ex: 2000 --> 2010, 1990 --> 2014)
  - **User-defined tract selections:**
    - tracts will default to entire BMA, but user will also be able to make tract subselections and map visualizations across those
    - the subselection is caused by filtering as such: user picks the `selection filter variable (SFV)` they want and then uses a slider to choose values within its whole value range -- tracts which fall within this `Selection Filter Variable Range` will be the subselection
    - for example: a user should be able to map income growth 1990-2014 for low-income tracts by defining a low-income tract as being in the bottom 4 deciles of tracts ranked by median tract income // via these steps:
      - user defines 'Decile of Income in 1990' as the `SFV`
      - user is then provided a slider based off the full range of the values within the `SFV` and selects tracts of deciles 1-4 as the `Selection Filter Variable Range`, areas outside of this filter are "greyed out"
      - with the subselection now shown, the user is now able to pick any variable to be the `data visualization variable` for mapping, in this case: 'Income Growth 1990-2014'
    - user should also be able to stack `SFVs` into a `Selection Filter Variable Stack`: 
      - up to 3 per stack
      - ex: a user should be able to create a two-variable stacked filter to look only at tracts that are low-income AND low-rent as of 2000 AND whatever
  - **Double stacking selections for a pass/fail data visualization:**
    - as well as the option of using a simple/single `Data Visualization Variable`, users will be granted the ability to cause a binary pass/fail (red/green) visualization based off of secondary selection
    - this could be done by taking the exact same logic from the `Selection Filter Variable Stacks`:
      - in essence this is like a doubling up of the `SFVS` stacks where the first `SFVS` causes the normal greying out and subselection and the second `SFVS` causes a visualization of its results within that subselection
      - for the user, the first `SVFS` would go on as normal // but the second would be some sort of special option/alternative in the Field selection area -- but perhaps with a very familiar UX to the one in the selection area
    - the data visualization `SVFS` will have a limit of 2 `SFVs` per stack whereas the normal `SVFS` will have 3 per stack

### Key Project Terms:
> - `Selection Filter Variable`: variable used to define the subselection of tracts
> - `Selection Filter Variable Range`: selected range of values defined by the user and returned for the `SFV` (this is intrinsic to an `SFV`, with the default being the whole range)
> - `Selection Filter Variable Stack`: when multiple `SFVs` and their associated ranges are used to define a tract subselection together
> - `Data Visualization Variable`: variables used to render the data visualizations

### Variables:
- Income:
  -	Median household income
  - Poverty rate of population 
- Housing Costs:
  - Median gross rent  
  - Median home value of owner occupied units  
  - Renter cost burden rate (share paying over 30% on housing)
  - Homeownership rate
- Education: 
  - Share of adults aged 25 and over with a Bachelor's degree
  - School enrollment rate for children age 5-17
- Demographics:
  - Share of pop by race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, Asian/other)
  - Share of households headed by young adults aged 25-34
- Family Type:  
  - Share of households that are non-family / with children / married-couple families (3 variables)
